* Worked on setting up matplotlib
* Found SymPy, a symbolic math parser
* Set up proper environment for 

#### Thursday, 2/11/21, 15:48
* Got rid of matplotlib for the built in sympy plotting utilities
* Introduced regex to the parser to help figure out what the equation is and reduce user error
* Cleaned up code
* NOTE: PLOT FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK

#### Saturday, 2/13/21, 00:34
* Added full comments
* Plot works now
* Trig functions can be used

#### Saturday 2/13/21, 02:08
* Added more comments
* Allowed multiple functions to be graphed at the same time

#### Thursday 3/4/21, 17:07
* Added derivative support
* Instructions are printed right at the start.
* Outputs two graphs, derivatives and equations.

#### Saturday 3/27/21, 23:29
* Made it easier for input recognition which now allows things like 'sin(x)' rather than 'sin( x )'
* Recognize issue with input 'd/dx(sin(x)'

#### Sunday 3/28/21, 01:04
* Completely re-wrote the code to make it prettier
* Removed comments because they made the code cluttered
* Fixed input issue and input works well

#### Monday, 3/29/21 12:05
* Recognized issue with input ‘d/dx(sin(x)**cos(x))’ in which it returns a log function.
* Fixed small amount of code towards the end

#### Thursday, 4/15/21 16:39
* Redesigned code

### TO-DO
* Add support for ln and log functions
* Bug fixes
